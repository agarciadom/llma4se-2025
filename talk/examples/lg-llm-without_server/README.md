# LangGraph + OpenAI examples without LangGraph Server

This is a series of examples for the LangGraph APIs, which do not use the LangGraph server.

To run these examples, copy the `.env.template` to `.env` and customise its variables accordingly.

You can then run an example through:

```shell
uv run example.py
```
